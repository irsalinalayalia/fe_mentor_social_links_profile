## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Through building this project, I strengthened my understanding of modern HTML and CSS techniques. Specifically, I learned:

- How to structure a clean and semantic HTML layout using elements like <div>, <ul>, <li>, and <img>.
- How to manage custom fonts using @font-face in CSS and apply them consistently across elements.
- How to use CSS variables (:root) to create a centralized and maintainable color and typography system.
- How to implement responsive design using clamp() for padding and width to adapt to various screen sizes.
- How to style interactive elements such as social media buttons with :hover effects to enhance user experience.
- The importance of Flexbox for building centered and responsive layouts.
- How to improve accessibility and user experience through consistent font sizing, contrast, and spacing.

This project helped me get more comfortable with layout styling, reusable design tokens (variables), and interactive hover states for better visual feedback.


### Useful resources

- [Jasoneczek's Profile on Front End Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/profile/jasoneczek) - This profile helped me out to know the exact size of the card and padding because my FE Mentor Member is not premium so I dont get the figma file and dont know the exact size and the Jasoneczek's profile helps me alot.
